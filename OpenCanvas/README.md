Bug at start. **Access violation at address xxxxxxx in module 'oC6.exe'** and **MM Operation after uninstall**. Apparently, there is an  error in the registry.

### To solve:

1. Go to ``regedit`` and find **portalgraphics**;
2. Drop down the folder and select the "opencanvasX.X steam edition" folder;
3. Delete it;
4. Finally, start OpenCanvas.
