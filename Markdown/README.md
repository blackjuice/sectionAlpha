Editors
=======
Currently (*160718*) using softwares are:

*OSX*: **MacDown**
*Windows*: **Atom** with the **markdown-preview-enhanced** package installed

### Other editors tried but left behind:

* **haroopad**: no feature for synced preview;
* **MarkdownPad2**: at first, live preview feature didn't worked, but was solved after the installation of Awesomium 1.6.6 SDK. Later on, links inside the editor software didn't work.

##### Link to a named anchor [(source)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6695439/how-do-you-create-link-to-a-named-anchor-in-multimarkdown)

To link words like Wikipedia:

previously:

	<a name="abcd"></a> The source here
	[link text](#abcd)

currently:

	#abcd <!--The source here (case sensitive: must be low-case) -->
	[link text](#abcd)
