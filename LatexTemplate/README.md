## Tips

* [image position](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/16207/image-from-includegraphics-showing-up-in-wrong-location)

      h : approximately here
      t : top of the page
      b : bottom of the page
      p : on a page that just has floats.
      ! : to put emphasis on a specifier --> h! means "really here"
      There are other options, but they require the float package.
