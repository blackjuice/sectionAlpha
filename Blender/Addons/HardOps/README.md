HardOps personal guide
======================
*creation date: 160718*

## Intro

> Hard Ops is a hard surface toolkit aimed to assist in making hard surface operations more efficient
*- from masterxeon1001's Hard Ops 006 Guide*

This Markdown page contains blackjuice's experience with HardOps, focusing mainly on guides on how to use the addon.

I'm mainly using Blender on Windows, from Steam. My path is:
`C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.77\scripts\addons`

## Quick note

So far, I've been using Haroopad for editing Markdown files, but I grew tired and searched for other alternatives. At [blackjuice/sectionAlpha/Markdown](https://github.com/blackjuice/sectionAlpha/tree/master/Markdown) contains the current (*160718*) editor that I'm using.

## Installing main package

> I recommend putting the contents in the zip in the Blender Add-on directory of the system. Installing from file may have an issue.

## Support packages (support addons) for HardOps

Check at the [Addons section](https://github.com/blackjuice/sectionAlpha/tree/master/Blender), on blackjuice's sectionAlpha repository in GitHub. There will be a table of my favorite addons.
