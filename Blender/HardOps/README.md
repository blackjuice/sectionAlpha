## Quick note

I'm currently searching for a Haroopad alternative, which is a Markdown preview editor software. Haroopad just doesn't work for me, it's not a pretty looking editor. The decisive factor is that on the left side of the screen, which is the Markdown text, without the preview look, when there is a tag, like a hyperlink for another piece of the page, the button for that text isn't at all clickable. I believe on the OSX, which I'm currently using the MacDown, this event works.
