Ray tracing:
Rays saem da camera e colidem com as paredes ate acharem uma fonte de luz

Lamp:
Blender ja sabe onde chegar

Environmental Lightning:
Blender nao sabe onde chegar: Environmental lighting tem muito ruido
Rays sao disparados em todos os lados


SAVING METHOD:  filename_01.blend
pressing + or - goes up or down on the filename


Mug:
    basic mirror
    Simple connection, manual

Cup of coffe:
    Smooth
    Cube Ctrl 2
    UV sphere
    Curves: apply curve

    Solidify and Looptools
        Circle
        10 vertices
        fill type: triangle fan
        modifier: solidify
        ADDON: LOOPTOOLS
        W -> special window

        Cup prato: bring solidify up from subdivision surface

    Spoon:
        K - key -cut
        J - connection

Tea bag holder:
    Shift R
    BoolTool

    Holes techniques:
        1. Alt Shift S:
            subdivide 2
            delete center vertice
        2. Ctrl Shift B:
            subdivide 1
            at center vertice: Ctrl Shift B
            subdivide
            delete middle vertice
            then Alt Shift S
            Connect lefting with J
        3. Bridge
            Cut square hole
            add circle in edit mode with same number of edges
            then W to Bridge Edge Loops

        4. Shift A to add Mesh circle
            V to Vector
            change to 2D
            Shift A to add another circle
            Alt C to finish

Cell Fracture
    Noise: break to smaller cubes - set to 1 is the highest
    recursvie: smaller inside big - set to 1
    Select random
    Set margin below Apply Split Edge box to 0 - space between 2 different fractures

    SET GROUP: ctrl G

Noiseless render
    Bigger lamp
    Bigger shadow size: lamp > spot > up size do 0.3
    For HDR, use Multiple importance Sample (tells Cycles to treat HDR as lamps) (at WORLD)
    Use filter glossy at Light paths (0.5)
    Use Clamp (up the Clamp indirect)
    Up samples


Freestyle Line art
    Change output to png, RGBA (alpha)
    Check freestyle
    Samples and render to 1
    Under Film, check TRANSPARENT
    Check if Freestyle Line set is a layer
    At layer section:
        Exclude all the layers from EXclude. To exclude any other render

At character development, show Sophie and start modeling her

Rig -> use MGS XNA

Sculpt -> Use on Cube and on Sophie

Control camera movement ->
